## Installation of the module

## Python Environment Setup

To use the Python-based generators and system tests, you need to install the `c-interop` package in editable mode,
from a shell with your target's python3 and pip in the path:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

By target's python3 / pip I mean either system-wide python3 (not recommended), or the venv of the project from which it is supposed to be used.
